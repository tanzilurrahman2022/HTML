>>What is HTML?

>>HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language." It is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. HTML provides a set of elements (tags) that are used to define the structure and semantics of a web page's content. These elements are used to describe various components of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, forms, and more.

In this example:

<!DOCTYPE html> declares the document type and version of HTML being used.
<html> is the root element that contains all other elements on the page.
<head> contains metadata about the document, such as the page title.
<title> sets the title that appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
<body> contains the visible content of the web page.
<h1> is a heading element.
<p> is a paragraph element.
<a> is a hyperlink element, used to create links.

HTML provides the basic structure and content of a webpage.
